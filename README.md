---

## Installation and Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/bright-scholarship.git
   cd bright-scholarship
   ```

2. **Set up the environment**:
   - Place the project folder in your web serverâ€™s root directory (e.g., `htdocs` for XAMPP).
   - Ensure PHP, SQLite, and Python are installed on the server.

3. **Database Configuration**:
   - Run `db.php` and `registrar_db.php` files to initialize the databases and tables. This will create the SQLite databases and populate sample data.

4. **File Permissions**:
   - Ensure the web server has read/write permissions on the database files.

5. **Configure the Web Server**:
   - If using Apache, ensure `.htaccess` files are enabled for security.

## Database Structure

The website uses two SQLite databases:
1. **`bright_scholarship_db.sqlite`** - Stores application data, users, votes, notifications, and logs.
2. **`registrar_db.sqlite`** - Holds the mock registrar's office data used for application verification.

### Database Tables

- **Users**: Stores user information, including roles (student, committee, admin).
- **Applications**: Stores application data, status, and associated student IDs.
- **Application Status Log**: Logs changes in application status with remarks.
- **Votes**: Records committee votes on each application.
- **Notifications**: Manages notifications for user actions.
- **Registrar Records**: Holds the registrar's mock records for verification.

---

## Notes and Known Limitations

- **Email Server**: Email notifications require a configured email server. By default, the `send_email` function uses the PHP `mail()` function, but it can be modified for SMTP or a third-party email API.
- **Python Integration**: Application verification requires Python. Ensure the server can execute Python scripts and that `verify_application.py` has execute permissions.
- **Security**: For production, implement stronger password policies and consider HTTPS.
